## Project Description
This project shows a personal website created using html and css. The pages include an index with my name, year, majors, a list of computer science classes I have taken at WPI, and a table showing my experience with technologies and methods. The next page "Hobbies" consists of an aside, and article talking about plants and gardening and includes a form at the bottom about plants. The next page is a link to the WPI home page, and the last page is a link to the website Gardenia where you can learn more about plants and gardening.

## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: The rules I added include font and color for each body, paragraph, and header. Attributes for the aside include padding and width to shape the box, float is which side the aside will be on, and the font and background color of the aside box. I also added styles to the tables where I decided the border, font, and width. For the navigation bar there are different style elements including margin, padding, overflow, float side, display type, colors for the bar, text, hovering, and the font. My biggest struggle was connecting the styles.css page because I did not have it saved in the right directory so the html files could not connect to it.

### Design Achievements
- **Used the Georgia Font**: I primarily used the Georgia Font for my pages and stuck to a shades of green color scheme shown in a1ColorPalette.jpg. I chose the green color scheme because green is my favorite color and it connects well with my plants and gardening hobbies. Adobe Color helped me look at the shades next to each other to decide between them.
